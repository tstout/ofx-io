Have you ever wanted to automate the downloading of your bank statements without resorting to web scraping?
If your financial institution supports Open Financial Exchange (http://www.ofx.net/) then ofx-io might
be able to help.

Ofx-io is a small wrapper for OFX4j http://ofx4j.sourceforge.net/. OFX4J deals with all the rolls of XML
toilet paper and OFX protocol details. Ofx-io merely provides a few conveniences I wanted.
